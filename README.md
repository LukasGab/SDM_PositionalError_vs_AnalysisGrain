# Positional errors are not overcome by the coarser grains
This repository was created as a supporting material for the article exploring the trade-offs between positional error and analysis grain in species distribution modeling.

**File Description:**

R_Script: Step-by-step guideline for generating virtual species, sampling occurrence data and simulating positional error.
Note that we can not provide the LiDAR data, we used for generating virtual species, because they are owned by Krkonose Mountains National Park (available upon request for research purposes). Thus, we created a `vs` object that can be used to recreate the data. The `vs` object can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f7ebUrg9NHzYIxw23TOOwFOg3LnGD661/view?usp=sharing).
